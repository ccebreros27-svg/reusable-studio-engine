# SYSTEM_CHARTER.md

Intent: Build a reusable engine that foregrounds clarity, speed, and creative agency for every new project.

Constraints:
- No libraries for the starter sketch (pure Canvas only)
- Docs and process are always separated from code
- Every file has a clear, single job

Tensions:
- Signal vs. noise
- Order vs. chaos

Taste vow: No overproduction, no visual clichés, no unnecessary effects.
