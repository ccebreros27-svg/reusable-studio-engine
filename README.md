# Reusable Studio Engine

A template repo for creative coding projects. Start new builds in minutes with a clean file system, docs ritual, and a working Canvas sketch.

## How to run locally
Open `index.html` in your browser, or use a simple local server (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`).

## How to deploy
- GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Deploy from main branch, root folder.
- Cloudflare Pages: Connect repo, no build command, output directory is root.

## How I use this to start projects
1. Copy this repo
2. Write intent in SYSTEM_CHARTER.md
3. Run Canvas and verify input works
4. Commit, deploy, and share the link
5. Use docs/process for planning and evidence
